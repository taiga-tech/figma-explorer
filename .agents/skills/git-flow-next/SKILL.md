description: >-
  Installs git-flow-next (the actively maintained Tower / gittower fork
  documented at https://git-flow.sh/) via mise's aqua backend, initializes
  the classic Gitflow preset, configures rebase as the upstream merge
  strategy for feature branches with a contributor-side interactive rebase
  that collapses the branch into a single commit with a hand-written
  message before finish, and runs the feature / release / hotfix flow
  with `git flow …` commands.
when_to_use: >-
  Use whenever Gitflow tooling is involved: starting / finishing
  feature, release, or hotfix branches; setting up `git flow` in a new
  repo; migrating off the abandoned nvie git-flow or gitflow-avh forks.
  Triggers: «настрой git-flow», «поставь git-flow», «начни фичу»,
  «заверши фичу одним коммитом», «схлопни фичу в один коммит»,
  «git flow init», «set up gitflow», «start a feature branch»,
  «finish feature as one commit», «collapse feature into one commit»,
  «release branch», «hotfix branch». Also triggers when the repo
  already carries `gitflow.*` git config keys or branches under
  `feature/`, `release/`, `hotfix/` prefixes.

# git-flow-next

git-flow-next (https://git-flow.sh/, repo `gittower/git-flow-next`)
is the Gitflow CLI this skill applies to —
no other git-flow forks.

## Do not confuse with the abandoned forks

Both legacy tools ship a `git-flow` binary too,
which makes mix-ups easy.

- `nvie/gitflow` —
  the original 2010-era shell script,
  unmaintained for over a decade.
- `petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh` —
  the AVH fork,
  no longer actively developed.

If `command -v git-flow` resolves outside mise's shim directory,
or `brew list` shows `git-flow` / `git-flow-avh`,
follow the **migrate from old git-flow / gitflow-avh** procedure
below before installing git-flow-next.
The binary name (`git-flow`) is the same;
only one can win on `$PATH`.

## Hard rules

1. **Only git-flow-next is allowed.**
   No `nvie/gitflow`, no `gitflow-avh`, no shell-script forks.
2. **Install through mise's aqua backend**, per the `mise` skill —
   pinned in `mise.toml` as `aqua:gittower/git-flow-next`,
   recorded in `mise.lock`.
   The explicit `aqua:` prefix is required here,
   overriding the `mise` skill's preference for bare names:
   the bare name `git-flow` is ambiguous in mise's registry
   (legacy `nvie/gitflow` and `gitflow-avh` claim it too),
   so naming the aqua package directly is the only way to be sure
   git-flow-next wins.
   No `brew install git-flow-next`,
   no manual binary downloads,
   no `go install`.
3. **Rebase-to-one-commit is the upstream merge strategy for feature
   branches.**
   The branch is collapsed into a single commit with a hand-written
   message _before_ finish (not by the merge tool),
   so the original authorship is preserved and the per-WIP commit
   messages don't end up concatenated on `develop`.
   Enforced once, in exactly one place per repo:

   - **Local-finish workflow** —
     set `gitflow.branch.feature.upstreamstrategy = rebase`
     so `git flow feature finish` rebases the feature branch onto
     `develop` linearly,
     no merge commit.
     The contributor is responsible for collapsing the branch to a
     single commit
     (`git rebase -i $(git merge-base HEAD develop)` with `fixup` on
     every non-first commit, then a clean message)
     _before_ running `git flow feature finish`.
     Do **not** use `upstreamstrategy = squash` —
     it creates a new commit without the original author and
     concatenates all commit messages by default,
     which is the behavior this policy exists to avoid.
   - **PR-review workflow** —
     leave that key unset and configure the hosting platform's PR-merge
     button to **rebase and merge** (not "squash and merge", not plain
     "create a merge commit").
     The contributor collapses the branch to a single commit locally
     (interactive rebase as above) before requesting review,
     so what lands on `develop` is the one clean commit they wrote.
     Hosting-platform "squash and merge" is **not** an acceptable
     substitute —
     by default it concatenates the per-commit messages into the body
     and,
     depending on platform settings,
     may attribute the resulting commit to the merger rather than the
     contributor.
     The merger has to override both manually on every PR.

   Pick one path per repo;
   mixing both double-applies or fails.
   Releases and hotfixes keep their default `merge` strategy
   so the merge commit and the version tag stay paired.

4. **Use the `classic` preset.**
   `main` and `develop` are the long-lived branches;
   topic prefixes are `feature/`, `release/`, `hotfix/`, `bugfix/`.
   Other presets (`github`, `gitlab`) are out of scope for this skill —
   if a project explicitly requires one,
   fall back to git-flow-next's upstream docs
   and do not apply the rest of this skill.

## Verifying memory against docs

git-flow-next is young and changes flag names, config keys, and
preset behavior between releases.
If anything below — command flags, config keys, preset contents,
binary names, version availability — looks unfamiliar or stale,
verify at https://git-flow.sh/docs before writing config or running
commands.
Do not guess.

## Procedure: install via mise

This skill specifies _what_ to install;
the `mise` skill governs _how_ —
creating `mise.toml` with the required `[settings]` block,
`mise trust` / `mise install` / `mise ls`,
the lockfile,
the commit.
If the project isn't on mise yet,
run the `mise` skill's setup procedure first;
do not duplicate its steps here.

git-flow-next-specific steps:

1. Pick a pinned version
   (releases:
   https://github.com/gittower/git-flow-next/releases).
2. Add the entry under `[tools]` in `mise.toml`
   via the explicit `aqua:` backend —
   the `pkgs/gittower/git-flow-next` aqua package ships a `git-flow`
   binary,
   and Hard rule 2 explains why the bare name is unsafe here:

   ```toml
   [tools]
   "aqua:gittower/git-flow-next" = "1.1.0"
   ```

3. After running the install per the `mise` skill,
   verify git-flow-next specifically:

   ```sh
   git flow version
   ```

   It should print the pinned version.
   If it prints something else,
   another `git-flow` binary is shadowing the mise-managed one on
   `$PATH` —
   locate it with `command -v git-flow` and remove it
   (the typical culprit is a Homebrew install of the old
   `git-flow` or `git-flow-avh`).

## Procedure: initialize a repository

Run from the repo root.
The `classic` preset configures Gitflow branches and prefixes:
`main` ← `develop` ← `feature/`,
plus `release/`, `hotfix/`, `bugfix/`.
`--defaults` skips the interactive prompts.

```sh
git flow init --preset=classic --defaults
```

If the production branch isn't `main`,
or any branch / prefix needs a different name,
drop `--defaults` and pass the documented overrides instead
(`--main=master`, `--develop=…`, `--feature=feat/`, etc.).

Then, in the local-finish workflow (Hard rule 3),
enable rebase on feature finish:

```sh
git config gitflow.branch.feature.upstreamstrategy rebase
```

In the PR-review workflow,
skip this command and configure the platform's PR-merge button
to "rebase and merge" instead.

Verify:

```sh
git config --get-regexp '^gitflow\.'
```

The output should list the preset's branch and prefix entries.
For the local-finish workflow it must also include
`gitflow.branch.feature.upstreamstrategy rebase`;
for the PR-review workflow that key must be absent.

## Procedure: feature branch lifecycle

The procedure below describes the **local-finish** workflow
(Hard rule 3):
the contributor collapses the feature branch into a single commit
locally,
then `git flow feature finish` rebases that one commit onto `develop`.
For the **PR-review** workflow,
jump to the alternative section below.

Start:

```sh
git flow feature start <name>
```

This creates `feature/<name>` from `develop` and checks it out.
Work on it normally —
commit, push for backup or sharing if needed.

Publish (optional, for shared work):

```sh
git flow feature publish <name>
```

Collapse to a single commit (Hard rule 3):
before finishing,
rebase the feature branch interactively against the current `develop`
and fold every commit but the first into it,
then rewrite the resulting commit message into a clean,
self-contained summary.

```sh
git rebase -i $(git merge-base HEAD develop)
# In the editor: keep the first line as `pick`,
# change every following line to `fixup` (drops their messages) or
# `squash` (keeps and lets you edit them).
# Save and exit; if you used `squash` or `reword`,
# the editor reopens for the final commit message —
# write a clean, self-contained summary.
```

Equivalent shortcut when none of the existing commit messages are
worth keeping:

```sh
git reset --soft $(git merge-base HEAD develop)
git commit -m "<clean summary of the feature>"
```

After the collapse,
`git log develop..HEAD` should show exactly one commit.

Finish:

```sh
git flow feature finish <name>
```

With `upstreamstrategy=rebase` set,
this:

1. switches to `develop`,
2. rebases the (now single-commit) `feature/<name>` onto `develop`
   linearly —
   no merge commit,
   original authorship and the hand-written message preserved,
3. deletes the local `feature/<name>` branch.

Push `develop` afterwards.
Argument-less shorthand works on the current branch:

```sh
git flow finish
```

If the collapse step is skipped,
`git flow feature finish` will still rebase,
but every WIP commit on the feature branch will land on `develop` as
a separate commit —
which is **not** the policy this skill enforces.
`finish` also deletes the feature branch,
so recovery means interactive-rebasing `develop` itself
(`git rebase -i origin/develop`) to fold the new commits into one
_before_ pushing —
only safe while those commits are still local.
Don't skip the collapse step.

### PR-review alternative

In the PR-review workflow (Hard rule 3),
the rebase-merge is produced by the hosting platform's
"rebase and merge" button,
not by `git flow feature finish`.
The contributor still collapses the branch to a single commit locally
_before_ opening or updating the PR
(same `git rebase -i` / `git reset --soft` procedure as above) —
otherwise multiple commits land on `develop`,
defeating the policy.
After the PR is merged:

- the remote feature branch is already gone
  (the platform deletes it on merge, in the typical settings);
- delete the local copy with `git branch -d feature/<name>`
  (or `git flow feature delete <name>`);
- do not run `git flow feature finish` —
  it would double-apply or fail.

## Procedure: release branches

Releases keep the default merge strategy
so the merge commit and the tag stay paired.

```sh
git flow release start 1.4.0
# bump version files, update changelog, commit
git flow release finish 1.4.0 --tag --message "release 1.4.0"
```

`release finish` merges into `main`,
tags the merge,
merges `main` back into `develop`,
and deletes the release branch.

## Procedure: hotfix branches

```sh
git flow hotfix start 1.4.1
# fix, commit
git flow hotfix finish 1.4.1 --tag --message "hotfix 1.4.1"
```

`hotfix finish` mirrors `release finish`:
merge to `main`,
tag,
merge `main` back into `develop`,
delete the hotfix branch.

## Procedure: bugfix branches

Bugfix branches target `develop` like features
but are reserved for non-feature defects;
production fixes go through `hotfix`.
The lifecycle mirrors features:

```sh
git flow bugfix start <name>
# fix, commit
git flow bugfix finish <name>
```

`bugfix finish` uses the default `merge` upstream strategy.
If the repo wants bugfixes collapsed like features
(local-finish workflow per Hard rule 3),
set the analogous key and follow the same collapse-then-finish
procedure (interactive rebase → single commit → finish):

```sh
git config gitflow.branch.bugfix.upstreamstrategy rebase
```

In the PR-review workflow,
treat bugfix branches the same as features —
the platform produces the rebase-merge,
no local `git flow bugfix finish`.

## Procedure: migrate from old git-flow / gitflow-avh

Trigger when `command -v git-flow` resolves to a Homebrew or manual
install of `nvie/gitflow` or `petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh`,
or when `brew list` / `apt list --installed` shows `git-flow` or
`gitflow-avh`.

1. Confirm the existing setup is a legacy fork:
   `command -v git-flow`,
   then `git-flow version` —
   the legacy AVH fork prints `AVH Edition`,
   nvie's prints a version like `0.4.x` with no Go/Tower attribution.
2. Read the legacy Gitflow config —
   only to extract the **branch and prefix names**,
   not to reapply verbatim.
   The legacy forks and git-flow-next use different key schemas
   (legacy: `gitflow.branch.master`, `gitflow.prefix.feature`;
   git-flow-next: `gitflow.branch.<type>.parent`,
   `gitflow.branch.<type>.prefix`),
   so the captured keys can't be replayed —
   they're a source for `git flow init` flag values:

   ```sh
   git config --get-regexp '^gitflow\.'
   ```

   Note the values for `gitflow.branch.master`,
   `gitflow.branch.develop`,
   `gitflow.prefix.feature`,
   `gitflow.prefix.release`,
   `gitflow.prefix.hotfix`,
   and `gitflow.prefix.bugfix`.

3. Remove the old binary:
   - Homebrew: `brew uninstall git-flow` or `brew uninstall git-flow-avh`.
   - Manual install: delete the binary from its `$PATH` location.
4. Install git-flow-next via the procedure above.
5. Re-run `git flow init`,
   passing the names captured in step 2 as overrides
   (omit any flag whose value already matches the classic-preset default):

   ```sh
   git flow init --preset=classic \
     --main=<captured master/main> \
     --develop=<captured develop> \
     --feature=<captured feature prefix> \
     --release=<captured release prefix> \
     --hotfix=<captured hotfix prefix> \
     --bugfix=<captured bugfix prefix>
   ```

   If every captured value matches the classic defaults,
   `git flow init --preset=classic --defaults` is enough.

6. Re-apply the rebase setting per the workflow (Hard rule 3):
   - local-finish:
     `git config gitflow.branch.feature.upstreamstrategy rebase`,
     and follow the collapse-then-finish procedure
     (interactive rebase → single commit → `git flow feature finish`)
     on every feature;
   - PR-review:
     skip the config,
     configure the platform's PR-merge button to "rebase and merge",
     and collapse feature branches to a single commit locally before
     opening the PR.
7. Verify `git flow version` reports the git-flow-next version
   from `mise.toml`,
   and `command -v git-flow` resolves into `~/.local/share/mise/`
   (or wherever mise materializes shims).

## Reporting

After changes,
state which `mise.toml` entry was added or updated
(tool, backend, version),
which `gitflow.*` keys were set,
which legacy binaries were removed,
and the next commands the user should run
(`git flow version`,
`git flow feature start <name>`,
or whatever fits the current task).
